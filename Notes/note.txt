    1. Object
    2. Primitive
       Number: Floating point numbers --> Used for decimals and integers 
        let age = 23;

       String: Seqience of character --> Used for text 
       let firstName = 'Jones';

       Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false --> Used for taking decisions 
       let fullAge = true;

       Undefined: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
       let childrean;

       Null: also means 'empty value'

       Symbol (ES2015): value that is unique and cannot be changed (Not useful for now)

       BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers than the Number type can hold 


       *** JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of value
       stored in a variable. Instead, data type are determined automatically ***

       /*
let variable can changeable (mutation)

// const immutable and we cannot Undefined

// birthYear = 1993;
const job;


// this is creating global variable, this is not good way to create a variable
lastName = 'jxkn';
console.log(lastName);
