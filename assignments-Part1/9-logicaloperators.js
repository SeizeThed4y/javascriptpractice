// 1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
// 2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a 
// country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an 
// island.
// 3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. 
// You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take 
// your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
// 4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If 
// not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
// 5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily 
// change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in 
// Canada :D
